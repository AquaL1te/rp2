\section{Future work}\label{fut}
TOSCA blueprints are conceptual
The VM and Kubernetes was deployed manually
Full implementation developed needed with an orchestrator such as e.g. DRIP
NDN is still experimental

Explore performance bottlenecks (benchmarking)" 
There is a lot of research to do in benchmarking. A lot of parameters can be configured to look for the most optimal configuration for NDN networking, such as exploring different MTU sizes, congestion treshold (packet delay/loss), pipeline type (for example cubic or aimd), NDN TCP vs NDN UDP, and running al these tests with multiple consumers. For benchmarking, the tool ndn-traffic-generator \footnote{https://github.com/named-data/ndn-traffic-generator} can be used to generate Interest and Data traffic in an NDN network. 


Test routing protocols (e.g. OSPFN)
Extent Kubernetes with intelligence
Where to deploy NDN routers (containers)?
Incorporate the PID -> NDN translation into NDN software natively
