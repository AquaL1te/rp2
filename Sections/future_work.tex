\section{Future work}
TOSCA blueprints are conceptual
The VM and Kubernetes was deployed manually
Full implementation developed needed with an orchestrator such as e.g. DRIP
NDN is still experimental
Explore performance bottlenecks (benchmarking)
Test routing protocols (e.g. OSPFN)
Extent Kubernetes with intelligence
Where to deploy NDN routers (containers)?
Incorporate the PID -> NDN translation into NDN software natively
