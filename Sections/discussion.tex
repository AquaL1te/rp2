For our PoC we used ndnputchunks to insert an object into NDN. However, ndnputchunks does not serve a file, but works with standard input stream. Data is cached in-memory and takes up to three times the size of the object for encoding \cite{ndnput-mem}. For a persistent file cache we recommend compiling ndn-cxx with file-server\footnote{https://github.com/yoursunny/ndn6-tools/blob/master/file-server.md}, \footnote{https://github.com/wentaoshang/NDNFS}NDNFS or \footnote{https://github.com/named-data/repo-ng}repo-ng.
