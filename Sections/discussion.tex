\section{Discussion}\label{disc}
%What 'advice' to give to the reader? Discuss difficulties (e.g. tosca) and such.

% include preliminary performance measurements, emphasize that it's outside the scope of our research, no real conclusions should be made, just observations, this needs to be made very clear

%Metadata, rules, web resolver link or not etc. all depending on PID and cloud proivider.

%Discussion or future work.
For our PoC we used \texttt{ndnputchunks} to insert an object into NDN. However, \texttt{ndnputchunk}s does not serve a file, but works with standard input stream. Data is cached in-memory and takes up to three times the size of the object for encoding \cite{ndnput-mem}. For using a persistent file cache we already compiled the base image of our PoC with repo-ng\footnote{https://github.com/named-data/repo-ng} as that makes use
%is part 
of the NDN-CXX application we used within our PoC. Repo-ng is an open source project and is used to set up a data repository for a persistent file cache.

For supporting multiple PID types, we have only implemented three PID types in our PoC, as this already proves that supporting multiple PID types is possible. Adding more PID types to our PoC, such as the ones described in Karakannas' research \cite{icn-bd} is possible but we see this more as work for an implementation.

TO-DO: Mention TOSCA difficulties.
