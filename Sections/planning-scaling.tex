Merge McCabe + TOSCA, use related work with NDN known performance bottlenecks/improvements as input

\subsection{NDN scalability}
Methodology explained, why use something, with what goal?

An NDN network uses routers, bandwidth and other resources to provide its users with a service. Therefore, the methodology described in McCabe can be used to plan an NDN network as well. However, traditional network designs focus on capacity planning, which is over-engineering the amount of network capacity needed. In NDN, with in-network caching, network traffic is distributed by design. Therefore, McCabe's systems methodology will be used, but slightly adapted to NDN.
