\section{Planning an NDN network with scalability in mind}
% first discuss how this all comes together; use case --> related work --> mccabe's --> tosca --> poc

% discuss relevant performance concerns/improvements from related work
% tcp vs udp
% cache size 1.3GB with 1 GB cache at edge
% twice the size of the biggest object in ndn for great performance
% cache stratgy 'leave copy everywhere' as baseline
% ascending order with least recently used cache replacement
% forward strategy doesn't really matter at this point


% use that as input for mccabe's method of planning a network
% goal: higher throughput, distributed load, flexible scaling
% use performance as input --> i suppose can only be used for deployment strategy (vm's --> docker), or be creative; append own method for this research
% this has as output the network diagram and certain requirements - briefly describe these requirements


% these then have to be merged into a tosca diagram
% describe tosca, applied with input from mccabe
% explain tosca diagram, the features, how it could meet the requirements defined by mccabe


% then describe what will be proven with the proof of concept
% that would be that tosca isn't implemented, but kubernetes its config is used as an abstraction for this
% with kubernetes its config the ndn network can be controlled in an sdn-style way
% describe ndn docker containers (how they can be controlled via kubernetes)
% conclude with the result of easy scaling an ndn network




\subsection{Planning an NDN network}
\label{method-planning}
% Merge McCabe's method and tosca as one method

Merge McCabe + TOSCA, use related work with NDN known performance bottlenecks/improvements as input

\subsection{NDN scalability}
Methodology explained, why use something, with what goal?

An NDN network uses routers, bandwidth and other resources to provide its users with a service. Therefore, the methodology described in McCabe can be used to plan an NDN network as well. However, traditional network designs focus on capacity planning, which is over-engineering the amount of network capacity needed. In NDN, with in-network caching, network traffic is distributed by design. Therefore, McCabe's systems methodology will be used, but slightly adapted to NDN.
