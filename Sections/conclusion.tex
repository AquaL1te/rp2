% \section{Conclusion}\label{conc}
% In this research we presented a design for sharing digital objects using NDN with support for multiple PID providers. Our findings give insight for distributed infrastructures that manage large and diverse sets of data such as SeaDataCloud and CS3.

% Initially, we started researching the state of the art technologies for creating our design. We came to the conclusion that NDN would fit the technical challenges we had to work out.
% After, we started researching PID interoperability with the NDN namespace and found out that our principles can be adhered as discussed in section \ref{pid-poc}. Metadata can be parsed to fill in possible naming gaps in an NDN name and the NDN namespace is unbounded. However long NDN names have to be taken in account, as that can degrade performance.
% As discussed in section \ref{planning-ndn}, we proved that our solution achieves flexible scaling and planning of an NDN network by managing the NDN infrastructure with Kubernetes.
% We concluded that a scalable and manageable data distribution network can be realized by using a VNF-style of an NDN deployment.
% Finally, we discuss preliminary performance measurements. Our results show that NDN over TCP gives the best performance, which correlates with previous work.

%TO-DO: extending the second part of the conclusion if needed.
%We simulated the use of TOSCA with an orchestrator like DRIP by using the YAML configuration of Kuberenetes which acts as a TOSCA template and the processing of this template
