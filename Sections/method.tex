\section{Methodology}
Short intro about it
-Show our model

\subsection{Interoperability}
Way of doing it described in detail, describe the 'how' answer
-Translation is transparent to the user
-Support for multiple PID types
-Extensible with future PID types with different naming schemes

\subsection{Planning an NDN network}
\label{method-planning}
Merge McCabe + TOSCA, use related work with NDN known performance bottlenecks/improvements as input

\subsection{NDN scalability}
Methodology explained, why use something, with what goal?
